# K&L Style Guide

The K&L Style Guide provides a way for us to standardise code across all K&L products (including any code produced by external agencies). This guide is important to us for a number of reasons.

* Improves the quality of the overall application by ensuring consistency
* Makes maintenance easier by removing style/layout as a barrier to entry
* Facilitates easy sharing of code between projects
* Promotes best practise

The guide is split into three sections.

* [HTML Guide](html.md)
* [CSS Guide](css.md)
* [JavaScript Guide](js.md)

## ESLint

Note that we have an ESLint config which should be used in any project using ESLint: see https://github.com/bbc/kandl-eslint-config for usage.
